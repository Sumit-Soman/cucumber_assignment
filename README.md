### Understanding is the basic code:
####Add the Feature file
Add the feature file under `test\resources\features\featurefile.feature`

#### Create the Runner

Add the Test runner at `test\java\testRunner\`
```java
@CucumberOptions(features = { "src/test/resources/features" }, 
        glue = {"stepdefinition",},
        plugin = { "pretty", "json:target/SearchFeatureRunner.json" })
public class TestRunner extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests {
}
``` 
Where: -
features: represent the location of feature files from the compiled build
plugin: html,json report properties
glue: where the hooks and step definition is defined



#### Use the testng.xml file to run the test cases

### Project Execution

Pretty Cucumber-Html Report
`C:\Users\S730737\Documents\Sumit\target\cucumber-report\cucumber-html-reports\overview-feature.html`
